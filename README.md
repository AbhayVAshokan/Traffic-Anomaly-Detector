# Traffic-Anomaly-Detector
The project is used to detect anomalies in the traffic flow in the CCTV footage. 

Whenever there is a green light and a traffic jam at the same time, it is an anomaly. This may be due to some accident or vehicle breakdown or some other reason. Anyway, it needs a quick response.
The project detects the anomaly using convolutional neural network. Whenever an anomaly is detected, it updates the database. The criticality of the anomaly is tested using accident detection algorithm.
